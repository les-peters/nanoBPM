# Database-driven business process management (BPM) system

Some of the more interesting work occurs when people are not distracted by work 
(see the collective works where "while I was in the shower" is mentioned). I am
no exception: my 20-years-and-counting log monitoring program is a great 
example of this (designed while on an Easter holiday weekend).

This is no different, although its seeds were sown during business hours. I 
was asked to review various free/low-cost business process management / 
workflow products, from which several things happened:

- my business email address is now in the rolodex of a half-dozen sales people
trying to convince me to spend money on their BPM product
- my company has no clear direction about how to extend our product line to 
additional clients using outside BPM products
- I now have a better idea of how every other company packages and sells BPM
products to other companies

So, on a recent transpacific flight, I had lots of time and an ample supply of 
Moleskin notepads, so in between binge watching movies, I wrote down the 
essence of a BPM system:

- everything is in a database (workflow, forms (definition, style, control),
back-end state engine)
- the type of database does not matter, lowering the bar for use by anyone
